# Edu_Credential_Fhe: A Secure DeSoc Protocol for Educational Credentials

Edu_Credential_Fhe is a revolutionary educational credentialing protocol that empowers schools and online courses to issue Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) encrypted and verifiable credits or certificates to students. At its core, this project harnesses **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, ensuring that sensitive educational data remains private while providing a robust verification mechanism.

## Tackling the Challenge of Educational Credentialing

In today's digital age, educational credentials often lack credibility due to the ease of forgery and the complexity of verifying qualifications. Traditional systems require institutions to disclose students' detailed academic histories, which raises privacy concerns. Students need a secure way to showcase their skills and accomplishments without compromising personal information or course details. This is where Edu_Credential_Fhe steps in.

## The FHE Solution: Elevating Privacy in Education

Edu_Credential_Fhe solves the aforementioned challenges by leveraging **Zama's open-source libraries** like **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**. With FHE, we can encrypt educational achievements in a manner that allows employers to validate a candidate's skills without exposing unnecessary details. This innovative approach ensures lifelong learning outputs can be securely recorded and displayed, creating a trustworthy and private educational ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **FHE Encrypted Credentials:** Students receive encrypted credits, safeguarding their privacy while allowing skills verification.
- **Private Learning Passport:** Students can compile multiple encrypted credentials into a secure and private profile.
- **Verification Without Exposure:** Employers can confirm a candidate’s qualifications without accessing the full academic record.
- **Decentralized Identity Framework:** Integrates decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for enhanced trust and authenticity in the educational realm.
- **Lifelong Learning Support:** Facilitates continuous skills validation as students progress through their educational journey.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK (zama-fhe SDK)**: Core component for implementing FHE.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum software.
- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **IPFS**: InterPlanetary File System for decentralized storage.

## Installation Guide

To set up Edu_Credential_Fhe, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **Node.js** (version 12 or higher).
2. **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum.

After ensuring you have the dependencies, follow these steps to get your environment ready:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Edu_Credential_Fhe

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

Please refrain from using `git clone` or any URLs to access the project, as this document contains all necessary details for setup.

## Build & Run Guide

Now that you have set up your environment, you can compile, test, and run Edu_Credential_Fhe with the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests to ensure everything works as expected:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the contract to a local network:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

## Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simple example of how to issue an FHE encrypted educational credential using our smart contract:

```solidity
// Edu_Credential_Fhe.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Edu_Credential_Fhe {
    struct Credential {
        bytes encryptedData;
        string issuedBy;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }

    mapping(address => Credential[]) public credentials;

    function issueCredential(bytes calldata _encryptedData, string calldata _issuedBy) external {
        credentials[msg.sender].push(Credential(_encryptedData, _issuedBy, block.timestamp));
    }
}
```

In this snippet, we define a smart contract that allows an institution to issue FHE encrypted educational credentials, providing verifiable records stored securely on the blockchain.
